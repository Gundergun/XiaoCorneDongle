I do not know what i am doing, i just followed the guide in zmk docs to make the dongle. 

If you are going to flash the firmware don't forget to use the settings_reset firmware for SeedStudio Xiao BLE.

Click on **Xiao BLE Settings reset firmware.uf2** in the directory and **view raw** to download the file ![{867B5AB2-3CF0-4C4A-ACAF-EAE5C801E11B}](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/841cb8bc-7294-476c-a5f8-cac5238a0eef)
